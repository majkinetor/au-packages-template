    <description>Graphical Traceroute Software

PingPlotter helps solve network problems. It's a network diagnostic tool that graphs latency and packet loss between your computer and a target. Visualizing the information accelerates your troubleshooting process and helps build a case if you ever need to convince someone a problem exists on their end.

PingPlotter is available in Professional, Standard, and Free editions. Professional edition offers the most capacity and features. Free edition offers the least, and Standard fits in between.
