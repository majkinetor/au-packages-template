    <description>Effective memory usage in .NET applications with dotMemory Unit

If you run tests with a standalone unit test runner (rather than Visual Studio) or want to make memory tests a part of your continuous integration builds, then you need a standalone dotMemory Unit launcher - the dotMemoryUnit.exe command-line tool.

dotMemoryUnit.exe works as a mediator - it runs a particular standalone unit test runner and provides the support for dotMemory Unit calls in the running tests.

### Check for objects

Checking for objects of a certain type is the main way to locate memory leaks in your code. With dotMemory Unit, you can specify a set of objects by almost any condition, calculate their number and size, and use this information in your assertions.

### Check memory traffic

When you need to simply evaluate the amount of memory allocated in a test, you can use the AssertTraffic attribute. This flexible attribute allows you to filter traffic data by object type, interface, or namespace.

### Compare snapshots

Like in the dotMemory profiler, you can use checkpoints not only for traffic amount assertions, but also for many kinds of snapshot comparisons.

### Continue analysis in dotMemory

Some memory issues will still require further manual investigation in dotMemory. Just set the rules when you want this done, and a workspace for further analysis in dotMemory will be created automatically.
