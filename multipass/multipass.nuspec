This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Multipass orchestrates virtual Ubuntu instances
    </summary>
<description>### Package Specific

This package allows configuring multipass via either of the two supported hypervisors. 
Hyper-V (and it's dependant Optional Windows Features) will be enabled if supported by your operating system. The version of Hyper-V supported by Multipass requires Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise build version 17134 or later.
Virtual Box must be preinstalled as it will not be installed with this package. If set to use Virtual Box, This package will set the driver to user Virtual Box, but other configuration may be necessary depending on your setup.

#### Package Parameters

The following package parameter can be set:
    
 * `/HyperVisor:` - Accepts 'VirtualBox' or 'Hyper-V' (default)
    
To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install bonobo-git-server [other options] --params="'/HyperVisor:VirtualBox'"`).
To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

#### Multipass

Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and HyperKit on macOS to run the VM with minimal overhead. It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and macOS. Multipass will fetch images for you and keep them up to date.

Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.

#### Uninstall

This package attempts to clean up files related to multipass by running it's uninstall.exe, but will not uninstall the hypervisor. </description>
