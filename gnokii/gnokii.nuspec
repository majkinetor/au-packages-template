    <description>Open source tools for your mobile phone

gnokii provides tools and a user space driver for use with mobile phones under various operating systems (most testing is done under Linux but also Solaris, *BSD family and MS Windows families are known to work). If you wonder whether your phone is supported or not, it is safe to assume it is supported, at least when the phone is fairly modern. However there are rare cases that make phone support very limited. You may refer to our wiki pages for hints in the gnokii configuration.
