<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

<description>File Converter is a very simple tool which allows you to convert and compress one or several file(s) using the context menu in windows explorer. And it's FREE!

The interface is designed to be as light as possible to keep the application pleasant to use.

It supports a lot of different file formats:

Category 	| Supported output formats	| Compatible input formats
----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Audio		| flac, aac, ogg, mp3, wav	| 3gp, aiff, ape, avi, bik, cda, flac, flv, m4a, mkv, mov, mp3, mp4, oga, ogg, wav, webm, wma, wmv
  Video		| webm, mkv, mp4, ogv, avi, gif	| 3gp, avi, bik, flv, gif, m4v, mkv, mp4, mpeg, mov, ogv, webm, wmv
  Image		| png, jpg, ico, webp		| bmp, exr, ico, jpg, jpeg, png, psd, svg, tiff, tga, webp, pdf, doc, docx, odt, odp, ods, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx
  Document       | pdf 				| doc, docx, odt, odp, ods, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, bmp, exr, ico, jpg, jpeg, png, psd, svg, tiff, tga

**You need to have Microsoft Office installed in order to convert Office documents.**

*Note: If your source file is a video, the conversion to an audio format will extract the audio part of the video.*

*Note 2: The mkv and mp4 output file format encodes video using H.264 encoder for video and AAC encoder for audio.*

*Note 3: The avi output file format encodes video using Xvid encoder for video and Mp3 encoder for audio.*
