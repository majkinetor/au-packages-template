    <description>CueMounter makes it easier to use audio disc images - .cue and an audio file. It mounts them as a virtual drive and allows you to explore the tracks inside as separate .wav files, play, analyze and recode them, without any intermediate storage.
You can use it to:
Split audio CD images to tracks, recode them to other formats or perform any other operation that is normally executed on temporary files, avoiding that overhead.
Decode all the supported audio files to wavs on the fly, avoiding hard disk usage and overhead
With the new AuCDTect integration: seamlessly analyze your compressed lossless tracks - one click away.
You can perform album analysis directly on audio CD images, without the need to split them
The only solution to analyze compressed files with AuCDTect without the need for temporary files or other hard disk usage
Use audio CD images split by tracks with software unaware of cue files transparently
Use the RAM Disk mounted under ramdisk for fast and painless temporary storage</description>
