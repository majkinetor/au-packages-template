    <description>ReQrypt is a tool for tunneling and encrypting web browser requests to hide
them from local (e.g. router-level, or ISP-level) snooping and interception.
ReQrypt is useful for bypassing ISP-level URL censorship/filtering/logging
systems.

Ordinarily, the HTTP request is sent directly to the web server, unencrypted.
This means it may be read and/or intercepted by a local eavesdropper, such as
your ISP, workplace, or shared family router.  However, with ReQrypt the
outgoing HTTP requests are encrypted and tunneled, rendering them unreadable
to any local eavesdropper.

ReQrypt is effective against systems that only attack outbound HTTP requests
only, and ignore inbound HTTP responses.  Such systems are very common is
ISP-level censorship and logging systems, since processing URL traffic (HTTP
requests) is significantly easier than processing web page responses.

Finally, unlike proxies, VPNs, Tor, etc., ReQrypt is not an anonymity tool.
It does not change the IP address of the tunneled packet.  This can be a good
thing: it means the web responses are sent directly to your PC which means
ReQrypt is typically faster than these other systems.
